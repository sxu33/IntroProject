<h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">About This Project</h1>

<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold my-2">Data Sources</h2>
<p>
  This project is a Rails application that demonstrates a collection of anime, their types, seasons, and heat ratings. 
  The data is sourced from the <a href="https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" target="_blank">Jikan API</a>,
   a free REST API for anime data, and the <a href="https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" target="_blank">Faker gem</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The application uses four main models to represent the data:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc ml-5">
  <li><strong>Anime:</strong> Represents individual anime titles with attributes such as title, background, and favorites. Data for this model is fetched from the Jikan API.</li>
  <li><strong>Type:</strong> Represents the type of anime, such as TV, Movie, OVA, etc. Types are generated using the Faker gem for demonstration purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Season:</strong> Represents the season in which the anime was aired, including attributes like name (e.g., Spring, Summer) and year. Data for this model is also fetched from the Jikan API.</li>
  <li><strong>Heat:</strong> Represents a heat rating for each anime, generated using the Faker gem to create a random value between 0 and 100 for demonstration purposes.</li>
</ul>
